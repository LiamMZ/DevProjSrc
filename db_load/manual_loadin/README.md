# Manual Database Creation and Load
## Written By: James Gallmeister

Run the config.sh file which should initialize your database.

You will need to create a user for postgres that does not require a password to log in with.
To fill manually:
*Unzip pass1.zip and pass2.zip
*Run `fillpost.py` and give the user you created above
	*Follow the instructions and your database should be filled once the script finishes.
